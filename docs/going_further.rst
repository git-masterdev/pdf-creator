Why Python?
-----------

Python is a really good language to design a small, OS-agnostic parser. As it
is object-oriented, it gives the possibility to follow the specification with
high-level classes and a small amount of very simple code.

And of course, WeasyPrint is written in Python too, giving an obvious reason
for this choice.

Speed is not pydyfâ€™s main goal. Code simplicity, maintainability and 
flexibility are more important goals for this library, as they give the 
ability to stay really close to the specification and to fix bugs easily.
